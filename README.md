## WebPy_HW10

The following has been completed in this task [^1]:

* Registration on the site and enter the site. 
* The ability to add a new author to the site, only for a registered user. 
* The ability to add a new quote to the site, indicating the author, only for a registered user. 
* You can go to the page of each author without user authentication 
* All quotes are viewable without user authentication

* Pagination. These are the next and previous buttons

However, I was not able to overcome the issue with the "*search for quotes by tags*", once pagination was implemented 
everything just collapsed.
